This repository process sequence data to generate an output file with the number of de novo variants present in someone infected with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A virus, relative to the genome of the person who infected them. We rely on data from McCrone et al., eLife, 2018, Popa et al., Science Translational Medicine, 2020, and Martin & KOelle, Science Translational Medicine, 2020.
